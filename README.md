My personal website, with source available for you to peruse.

## About

Webpack is used to compile static HTML, CSS, and JS. The build is designed to produce a directory that can be served by any very simple Apache/nginx/Express static file server.

While currently a single page site, a few choices were made to allow easy future expansion, including the usage of EJS partials and the SCSS organization and naming conventions.
